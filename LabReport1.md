For cd + no arguments, nothing happens because the cd is searching for a directory & in this case, there isn't anything to search. For cd + directory, the prompt changes to which directory the terminal is now in. For cd + file, there's an error because the terminal doesn't allow that because cd searches for directories.

For ls + no arguments, the terminal prints the folders available in the workspace (in this case, lecture1 is the only folder so the terminal prints lecture1). For ls + directory (lecture1) as an argument, the terminal prints out the files found in the directory. For ls + file (.txt file), there's an error because terminal doesn't allow that because ls is searching for files or directory within itself.

For cat + no argument, nothing prints. For cat + directory (lecture1), the terminal prints "cat: lecture1: is a directory". I `cd lecture1` to get into lecture1 directory. I tried to cat lecture1 again, but it says no file or directory because a lecture1 file or directory doesn't exist in the lecture1. For cat + file (Hello.java), the directory prints out the conetnt of the file.
